# kora-personal

**kora** is an idea for a new web-based platform that is a digital commons for 
music discovery.

`kora-personal` contains the infrastructure for the individual aspect of the 
platform: an interactive space to document and catalog your music from your 
streaming history aided by self-organizing principles.

**kora** is guided by the philosophy of 
[Open Design](https://github.com/OpenDesign-WorkingGroup/Open-Design-Definition/blob/master/open.design_definition/open.design.definition.md) 
with the goal of building a living, open-source platform self-sustained 
through the community.
